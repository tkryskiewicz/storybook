# CRNA Kitchen Sink

This project was bootstrapped wit [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli) and storybook using [storybook CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/cli).

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
2. Delete node_modules/@storybook
3. Run the storybook server: `yarn storybook`
4. Run the app: `yarn start`

## Iterate on app/react-native

Changes to the yarn workspace do not currently reflect live in this app. To iterate on the react native pieces of storybook, use `scripts/update-crna-kitchen-sink`.
